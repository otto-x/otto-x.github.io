## But why?

I just thought this looks nice.

## Tags Cloud

1. Create a page named `tags`
2. Edit tags page, set page type to `tags`

## Search

If you want search support with this theme, install `hexo-generator-lunr`. After the installation, do `hexo generate` again, and you will have this feature enable automagically. 

* Caveat
  * If you use `npm install hexo-generator-lunr`, it will install the package from [o2team](https://github.com/o2team/hexo-generator-lunr), which only indexes the excerpt of post.
  * Therefore, if you want full text search, use [my fork](https://git.fm/zllovesuki/hexo-generator-lunr).
  * If you are running Hexo 3.2.2, and you are running your Hexo in a folder, your permalink may have repeated subfolder (e.g. /blog becomes /blog/blog). The latest `hexo@beta` solves this problem.
